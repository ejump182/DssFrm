## Cloud vs. self-hosted

We offer you a ready hosted and maintained version of Formbricks HQ on [formbricks.com](https://hq.formbricks.com). It is currently in a open beta phase, free to use and always up to date. If you want to try Formbricks HQ, or save yourself the hassle and stress of self-hosting, this is the place to start.

The version of Formbricks HQ you'll find in this repository is the same version that runs in the cloud, and you can easily host it yourself on your servers. Check out our [docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/formbricks-hq/self-hosting) to see how to self-host Formbricks HQ.

(In the future we may develop additional features that aren't in the free Open-Source version)
