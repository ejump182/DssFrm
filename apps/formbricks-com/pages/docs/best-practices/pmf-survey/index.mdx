  title: "Product-Market Fit Survey",
  description: "The Product-Market Fit survey helps you measure, well, Product-Market Fit (PMF).",
};

## Purpose

Measuring and understanding your PMF is essential to build a large, successful business. It helps you understand what users like, what they‚Äôre missing and what to build next. This survey is perfectly suited to measure PMF like Superhuman (ADD LINK).

## Formbricks Approach

- Pre-segment users to only survey users who have experienced your products value
- Never ask twice, keep your data clean
- Run on autopilot: Set up once, keep surveying users continuously

### Preview

## Overview

To display the Missed Trial Conversion survey in your app you have to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Product-Market Fit survey at [app.formbricks.com](http://app.formbricks.com/)
2. Setup pre-segmentation to assure high data quality
3. Setup the user action to display survey at good point in time

<Callout title="Formbricks Widget not yet running?" type="note">
  We assume that you have already installed the Formbricks Widget in your web app. It‚Äôs required to display
  messages and surveys in your app. If not, please follow the Quick Start Guide (takes 15mins max.)
  (/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
</Callout>

### 1. Create new PMF survey

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Survey" and choose the template ‚ÄúProduct-Market Fit Survey‚Äù:

### 2. Update questions (if you like)

You‚Äôre free to update the question and answer options. However, based on our experience, we suggest giving the provided template a go üòä Here is a very detailed description of what to do with the data you‚Äôre collecting.(ADD LINK)

_Want to change the button color? You can do so in the product settings!_

Save, and move over to where the magic happens: The ‚ÄúAudience‚Äù tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience

To run this survey properly, you should pre-segment your user base. As touched upon earlier: if you ask every user you‚Äôll get lots of opnions which are often misleading. You only want to gather feedback from people who invested the time to get to know and use your product:

**Filter by attribute**: You can keep the logic to decide if a user has or has not experienced in your application. This makes most sense if you want to use historic usage data to decide if a user qualifies or not. Create your logic and if it applies, send an attribute to Formbricks by e.g. `formbricks.setAttribute("Loyalty", "Experienced Value");` Here is the full manual on how to set attributes(ADD LINK).

**Filter by actions**: You can also segment users based on events tracked with Formbricks. However, this makes it impossible to use historic usage data. Here we have a few options to achieve that:

- Check the time passed since sign-up (e.g. signed up 4 weeks ago) - _low fidelity_
- User has performed a specific action a certain number of times or (e.g. created 5 reports)
- User has performed a combination of actions (e.g. created a report **and** invited a team member)

This way you make sure that you separate potentially misleading opinions from valuable insights. Once again: Formbricks can only access user actions which were tracked with Formbricks.

### 4. Set up a trigger for the Product-Market Fit survey:

You need to set a trigger but in this case, the filtering does all the work. It‚Äôs up to you to decide to display the survey after the user viewed a specific subpage (pageURL) or after clicking an element.

### 5. Select Action in the ‚ÄúWhen to ask‚Äù card

### 6. Last step: Set Recontact Options correctly

Lastly, scroll down to ‚ÄúRecontact Options‚Äù. Here you have to choose the correct settings to make sure your data remains of high quality. You want to make sure that this survey is only responded to once per user. It is up to you to decide if you want to display it several times, until the user respondes.
