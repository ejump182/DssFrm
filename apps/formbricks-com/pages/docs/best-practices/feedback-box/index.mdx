The Feedback Box gives your users a direct channel to share their feedback and feel heard.

## Purpose

Allow users to share feedback with 2 clicks. A low friction way to gather feedback helps catching even the smallest points of annoyance / frustration in user experiences.

## Formbricks Approach

- Make it **easy**: 2 clicks to share feedback
- **Pre-sort** feedback:
  - Bug ‚Üí Pipe into Bug channel for devs
  - Feedback ‚Üí Pipe into Feedback channel for PM‚Äôs

## Installation

To add the Feedback Box to your app, you need to perform these steps:

1. Create new Feedback Box at app.formbricks.com
2. Setup Feedback Box with template
3. Use NPM to install or embed JS snippet in `<head>`
4. Test

### 1. Create new Feedback Box

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Then, create a new survey and select the "Feedback Box" template:

### 2. Create "Feedback Box"

Click on "Create Survey" and choose the template ‚ÄúFeedback Box‚Äù:

<Image src={CreateFeedbackBox} alt="Create feedback box by template" quality="100" />

### 3. Update question content

Change the questions according to your preference:

<Image src={ChangeTextContent} alt="Change text content" quality="100" />

### 4. Create user action to trigger Feedback Box:

Go to the ‚ÄúAudience‚Äù tab, find the ‚ÄúWhen to send‚Äù card and choose ‚ÄúAdd Action‚Äù. We will now use our super cool No-Code User Action Tracker:

<Image src={AddAction} alt="Add action" quality="100" />

<Callout title="You can also add actions in your code" type="note">
  You can also create [Code Actions](/docs/actions/code) using `formbricks.track("Eventname")` - they will
  automatically appear in your Actions overview as long as the SDK is embedded.
</Callout>

We have two options to track the Feedback Button in your application: innerText and CSS-Selector:

1. **innerText:** This means that whenever a user clicks any HTML item in your app which has an `innerText` of `Feedback` the Feedback Box will be displayed.
2. **CSS-Selector:** This means that when an element with a specific CSS-Selector e.g. `#feedback-button`

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 space-x-2">
  <Image src={AddCSSAction} alt="Add CSS action" quality="100" />
  <Image src={AddHTMLAction} alt="Add HTML action" quality="100" />
</div>

### 5. Select action in the ‚ÄúWhen to ask‚Äù card

<Image src={SelectAction} alt="Select feedback button action" quality="100" />

### 6. Set Recontact Options correctly

Scroll down to ‚ÄúRecontact Options‚Äù. Here you have to choose the right settings so that the Feedback Box pops up every time (our default is that every user sees every survey only once):

<Image src={RecontactOptions} alt="Set recontact options" quality="100" />

### 7. You‚Äôre ready publish your survey!

<Image src={PublishSurvey} alt="Publish survey" quality="100" />
