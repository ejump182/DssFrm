};

The Feedback Box is an easy way to gather feedback from your users.

##

## Installation

### NPM Install

The easiest way to get the Feedback Box live on your page is via NPM:

```tsx
npm install formbricks/feedback
```

### JavaScript Embed

You can also embed the Feedback Box in your HTML `<head>` tag:

```tsx
<script>
window.formbricks = {
  config: {
    hqUrl: "https://app.formbricks.com",
    formId: "cldipcgat0000mn0g31a8pdse",
  },
  ...window.formbricks,
};
</script>
```

## Setting up the config

You can change the content behaviour of the Feedback Box with the config object.

### Personalizing

Add your name, position and image link to give users the impression that you care about their feedback :)

```tsx
contact: {
  name: "Johannes",
  position: "Co-Founder",
  imgUrl: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72809645?v=4",
},
```

### Sending user data with feedback

The feedback box is built for in-app experiences. We assume that you already have user properties stored in a session object.

Here is an example of how to pass it to Formbricks. However, it might differ in your specific case.

```tsx
customer: {
  id: "",
  name: "",
  email: "",
},
```

### Styling

You can style the Feedback Box to match your UI. We recommend to at least replace the brand color with your main color.

```tsx
style:
{
  brandColor: "#00c4b8",
},
```

Here are all variables you can set with the current defaults:

```tsx
style:
{
  brandColor: "#00c4b8",
  borderRadius: "0.4rem",
  headerBGColor: "#1e293b",
  headerTitleColor
  boxBGColor: "#cbd5e1",
  textColor: "#0f172a",
  buttonHoverColor: "#e2e8f0",
},
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
