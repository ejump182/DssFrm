};

The Interview Prompt allows you to pick a specific user segment (e.g. Power Users) and invite them to a user interview. Bye, bye spammy email invites, benefit from up to 6x more respondents.

## Purpose

Allow users to share feedback with 2 clicks. A low friction way to gather feedback helps catching even the smallest points of annoyance / frustration in user experiences.

## Formbricks Approach

- Pre-segment users with custom attributes. Only invite highly relevant users.
- In-app prompts have a significantly higher conversion rate.
- Set scheduling user interviews on auto pilot.
- Soon: Integrate directly with your [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) account.

## Installation

To display an Interview Prompt in your app you have to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Interview Prompt at [app.formbricks.com](http://app.formbricks.com/)
2. Adjust content and settings
3. That’s it! 🎉

<Callout title="Formbricks Widget not yet running?" type="note">
  We assume that you have already installed the Formbricks Widget in your web app. It’s required to display
  messages and surveys in your app. If not, please follow the Quick Start
  Guide(/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
</Callout>

### 1. Create new Interview Box

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Survey" and choose the template “Feedback Box”:

### 2. Update prompt and CTA

Update the prompt, description and button text to match your products tonality. You can also update the button color in the Product Settings.

<Image src={ChangeTextContent} alt="Change text content" quality="100" />

In the button settings you have to make sure it is set to “External URL”. In the URL field, copy your booking link (e.g. cal.com/johannes/interview). If you don’t have a booking link yet, head over to [cal.com](http://cal.com) and get one - they have the best free plan out there!

Save, and move over to the “Audience” tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience

Once you clicked over to the “Audience” tab you can change the settings. In the **Who To Send** card, select “Filter audience by attribute”. This allows you to only show the prompt to a specific segment of your user base.

In our case, we want to select users who we have assigned the attribute “Power User”. To learn how to assign attributes to your users, please follow this guide (LINK).

Great, now only the “Power User” segment will see our interview prompt. But when will they see it?

### 4. Set up a trigger for the Interview Prompt:

We assume that you have not yet created the correct trigger to show your Interview Promp. To create one, go to the “Audience” tab, find the “When to send” card and choose “Add Action”. We will now use our super cool No-Code User Action Tracker:

<Image src={AddAction} alt="Add action" quality="100" />

<Callout title="You can also add actions in your code" type="note">
  You can also create [Code Actions](notion://www.notion.so/docs/actions/code) using
  `formbricks.track("Eventname")` - they will automatically appear in your Actions overview as long as the SDK
  is embedded.
</Callout>

Generally, we have two types of user actions: Page views and clicks. With the interview prompt, you’ll likely want to display it on a page visit since you already filter who sees the prompt by attributes.

1. **pageURL:** Whenever a user visits a page the survey will be displayed, as long as the other conditions match.

2. **innerText & CSS-Selector:** When a user clicks an element (like a button) with a specific text content or CSS selector, the prompt will be displayed (as long as the other conditions match as well e.g. filter, when this user saw the last survey, etc).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 space-x-2">
  <Image src={AddCSSAction} alt="Add CSS action" quality="100" />
  <Image src={AddHTMLAction} alt="Add HTML action" quality="100" />
</div>

### 5. Select action in the “When to ask” card

<Image src={SelectAction} alt="Select feedback button action" quality="100" />

### 6. Set Recontact Options correctly

Scroll down to “Recontact Options”. Here you have to choose the correct settings to strike the right balance between asking for user feedback and bothering users to frequently. Your settings also depend on the size of your user base or segment. If you e.g. have thousands of “Power Users” you can easily afford to only display the prompt once. If you have a smaller user base you might want to ask twice to get a sufficient amount of bookings:

### 7. You’re ready to publish your survey!
