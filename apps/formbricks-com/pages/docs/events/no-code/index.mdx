  title: "No-Code Events",
};

No-Code events can be set up within Formbricks with just a few clicks. There are three types of No-Code events:

## Page URL Event

The page URL event is triggered, when a user visits a specific page in your application. There are several match conditions:

- `exactMatch`: The value should exactly match the specified condition.
- `contains`: The value should contain the specified condition as a substring.
- `startsWith`: The value should start with the specified condition.
- `endsWith`: The value should end with the specified condition.
- `notMatch`: The value should not exactly match the specified condition.
- `notContains`: The value should not contain the specified condition as a substring.

## innerText Event (coming soon)

The innerText event checks if the `innerText` of a clicked HTML element matches a specific text.

## CSS Selector Event (coming soon)

The CSS Selector event checks if the CSS selector matches the `id` of a clicked HTML element matches a specific text.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
