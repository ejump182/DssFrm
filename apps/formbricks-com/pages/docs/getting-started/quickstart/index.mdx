In app surveys have a 6 to 10 times higher conversion rate then emailed out surveys. This tutorial explains how to run an in app survey in your web app in 10 to 15 minutes. Let‚Äôs go!

## 1. Create a free Formbricks Cloud account

While you can self-host Formbricks, he quickest and easiest way to get started it with our free Cloud plan. Just sign up here and click through the Onboarding, until you‚Äôre here:

## 2. Create your first survey

To be able to see a survey in your app, you need to create one. We‚Äôll choose one of the templates and head over to the survey settings:

<Image src={I2} alt="Settings for popup survey inside web app" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

As you can see in the orange note here, we have not yet connected Formbricks Cloud with our app. We will do so in just a minute, let‚Äôs first setup the survey correctly.

Select ‚ÄúWeb App‚Äù in the How to ask settings:

<Image src={I3} alt="Survey settings for popup micro surve" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

Scroll down to Survey Trigger and choose ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù. This will cause this survey to appearwhen the Formbricks Widget tracks a new user session:

  alt="In app survey trigger for feedback popup micro survey"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

In Recontact Options we make these settings, so that we can play around with it more easily. By default, each survey will be shown to each user only one time to prevent survey fatigue:

<Image src={I5} alt="Options for survey popup in app micro survey" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

Now hit **Publish** and you‚Äôll be forwarded to the Summary Page. This is where you‚Äôll find the responses to this survey. On the Summary Page click through to the Setup Checklist:

<Image src={I6} alt="pop up survey settings for inapp web survey" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

## 3. Set up the Formbricks Widget in your app

On the Setup Checklist you have two elements: A widget status indicator and a step by step manual on how to setup Formbricks.

At the top you find the Widget Status Indivator. Once your app is connected to Formbricks Cloud successfully, this will turn green:

<Image src={I7} alt="feedback popup in app survey" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

In the manual, this code snippet contains all the information you need:

- The **environment ID** of your current Formbricks workspace
- The **API Host** which is ‚Äòhttps://app.formbricks.com‚Äô for Cloud users

## Debugging - Most common errors

In case you don‚Äôt see your survey right away, there is no need to worry. Here are the most frequent errors and how to fix them. Go through them in this order to find the error fast:

1. **Formbricks Cloud and your app are not connected properly.**

Go back to [app.formbricks.com](http://app.formbricks.com) and check go to the Setup Checklist in the Settings. If the status is still indicated as ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù your app has not yet sent pinged the Formbricks Cloud:

<Image
  src={I9}
  alt="setup checklist ui of survey popup for in app surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
**How to fix it:**

1. Check if your app loads the Formbricks widget correctly. Go to X, Y, Z

1. **Survey not loaded**

If your app is connected with Formbricks Cloud, the survey might have not been loaded properly. Check the debug logs and search for the list of surveys loaded. It should look like so:

SURVEY LIST DEBUG LOGS

**How to fix it:**

The widget only loads surveys which are **public** and **in progress**. Go to Formbricks Cloud and to the Survey Summary page. Check if your survey is live:

<Image src={I10} alt="ui of survey popup for in app micro surveys" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

1. **Survey not triggered**

If the survey is loaded by the widget it might not have been triggered properly.

**How to fix:**

1. Check the debug logs for ‚ÄúEvent ‚ÄòNew Session‚Äù tracked‚Äù. If you see it in the logs and the survey still did not get displayed, [pls let us know.](mailto:support@formbricks.com)
2. Open your local app in an incognito tab or window. The New Session event is only fired if a user was inactive for X or was logged out of Formbricks via formrbicks.logout().

That should fix it! If not, please [join our Discord](https://formbricks.com/discord)! We‚Äôre more than happy to help you get started üòä
