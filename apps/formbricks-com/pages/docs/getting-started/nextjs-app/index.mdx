    "Setting up Formbricks with the new Next.js 13 App Directory can be tricky. Follow this guide to make sure you get it right.",
};

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Formbricks SDK into a Next.js application using the new app directory. As the Formbricks SDK only works on the client side, it's essential to ensure proper integration to avoid any issues.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. A Next.js application set up and running.
2. A Formbricks account with access to your environment ID and API host. You can find these in the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings:

## Installing Formbricks SDK

First, you need to install the Formbricks SDK using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save @formbricks/js
# or
yarn add @formbricks/js
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

## Integrating with Next.js 13 App Directory

The Next.js 13 app directory requires us to initialize Formbricks differently than the pages directory. Specifically, the app directory server-side renders components by default, and the formbricks-js library is a client-side library. To make these work together, create a `formbricks.js` file (or formbricks.ts if you are using Typescript) and set up the FormbricksProvider with the 'use client' directive:

```tsx
// app/formbricks.js
"use client";
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  formbricks.init({
    environmentId: "your-environment-id",
    apiHost: "your-api-host", // e.g. https://app.formbricks.com
    logLevel: "debug", // remove when in production
  });
}

export default function Providers({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    formbricks?.registerRouteChange();
  }, [pathname, searchParams]);

  return null;
}
```

Once we do this, we can then import the `provider.js` file in our `app/layout.js` file, and wrap our app in the Formbricks provider.

```tsx
// app/layout.js
import Providers from "./formbricks";

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <Providers />
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Validate your setup

Once you have completed the steps above, you can validate your setup by checking the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings. Your widget status indicator should go from this:

<Image src={WidgetNotConnected} alt="Widget isnt connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

To this:

<Image src={WidgetConnected} alt="Widget is connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
