};

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. A React application created with 'create-react-app'.
2. A Formbricks account with access to your environment ID and API host. You can find these in the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings:

## 1. Installing Formbricks SDK

First, you need to install the Formbricks SDK using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save @formbricks/js
# or
yarn add @formbricks/js
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

## 2. Integrating with React

Update your App.tsx file like so:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  formbricks.init({
    environmentId: "your-environment-id",
    apiHost: "your-api-host", // e.g. https://app.formbricks.com
    debug: true, // remove when in production
  });
}

function App() {
  // Your component logic here if needed

  return <div>{/* Your component content or other components */}</div>;
}

export default App;
```

## What are we doing here?

The app initializes 'formbricks' when it's loaded in a browser environment (due to the typeof window !== "undefined" check) and then renders your components or content.

## 3. Validate your setup

Once you have completed the steps above, you can validate your setup by checking the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings. Your widget status indicator should go from this:

<Image src={WidgetNotConnected} alt="Widget isnt connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

To this:

<Image src={WidgetConnected} alt="Widget is connected" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
