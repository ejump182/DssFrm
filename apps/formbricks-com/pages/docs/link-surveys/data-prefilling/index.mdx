  title: "Data Prefilling in Link Surveys",
  description: "Prefill data in your surveys to make it easier for your users to provide feedback.",
};

Data prefilling via the URL allows you to increase conversion rate by prefilling data you already have in a different system.

## Purpose

URL prefilling of data comes in handy when you:

- Have data for some of the respondents, but not all
- Have data in a different system (e.g. your database) and want to add it to the user profile in Formbricks
- Want to embed the first question in an email and increase conversion by prefilling the choice

## Quick Example

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?question_id=5
```

## How it works

To prefill the first question of a survey, append `?question_id=answer` at the end of the survey URL. The answer has to match the expected type of the question. For example, if the first question is a rating question, the answer has to be a number. If the first question is a single select question, the answer has to be a string.

Please make sure the answer is [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/).

<Callout title="Prefill only the first question" type="note">
  Currently, you can only prefill the first question of a link survey.
</Callout>

## Where do I find my question Id?

You find the `questionId` in the Advanced Settings at the bottom of each question card in the Survey Editor. As you see, you can update the `questionId` to any string you like. However, once you published your survey, this `questionId` cannot be updated anymore:

<Image
  src={QuestionId}
  alt="The question Id is located at the bottom of each question card in the survey editor."
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Rating Question

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?rating_question_id=5

// -> translates to 5 stars / points / emojis
```

### NPS Question

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?nps_question_id=10

// -> translates to an NPS rating of 10
```

### Single Select Question (Radio)

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?single_select_question_id=Very%20disappointed

// -> Chooses the option "Very disappointed" in the single select question. The string has to be identical to the option in your question.
```

### Multi Select Question (Checkbox)

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?single_select_question_id=Sun%2CPalms%2CBeach

// -> Selects three options "Sun, Palms and Beach" in the multi select question. The strings have to be identical to the options in your question.
```

### Open Text Question

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?openText_question_id=I%20love%20Formbricks

// -> Adds "I love Formbricks" as the answer to the open text question
```

### CTA Question

```tsx
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?cta_question_id=clicked

// -> Adds "clicked" as the answer to the CTA question. Alternatively, you can set it to "dismissed" to skip the question.
```

## Validation

Make sure that the answer in the URL matches the expected type for the first question.

The URL validation works as follows:

- For Rating or NPS questions, the response is parsed as a number and verified if it's accepted by the schema.
- For CTA type questions, the valid values are "clicked" (main CTA) and "dismissed" (skip CTA).
- For Consent type questions, the valid values are "accepted" (consent given) and "dismissed" (consent not given).
- All other question types are strings.
