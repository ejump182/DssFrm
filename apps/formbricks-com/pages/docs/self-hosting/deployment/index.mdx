    "Utilize Docker-Compose for easy deployment on your machine. Clone the repo, configure settings, and build the image to access the app on localhost.",
};

At Formbricks, we understand that different users have different needs, and we strive to cater to a wide variety of situations. This is why we provide two ways of running our application using Docker:

1. **Fast Setup with a Pre-built Docker Image:** This method is designed for those who want to quickly set up and start using Formbricks without getting into the technicalities of Docker or the build process. When you choose this method, you're using an image that we've already built for you. The pre-built image is ready-to-run, and it only requires minimal configuration on your part. This approach is perfect for getting a functional instance of Formbricks up and running with minimal hassle. It's as easy as downloading the Docker image and firing up the container.

2. **Manual Setup by Building the Docker Image from Source:** This approach provides the flexibility to configure every aspect of your Formbricks instance, including environment variables that need to be set at build time. While we don't recommend changing the source code of Formbricks, this method allows you to set your own configuration that might be necessary for specific deployment needs. Keep in mind that this method requires a more in-depth understanding of Docker and the build process. However, the trade-off is the additional control and flexibility you gain, making it worth considering if you're a more advanced user or have very specific configuration needs.

Please note that regardless of the method you choose, Formbricks is designed to be easy-to-use and flexible. So choose the method that best fits your comfort level and requirements, and start leveraging the power of Formbricks today!

## Requirements

Ensure `docker` & `docker compose` are installed on your server/system. Both are typically included with Docker utilities, like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

**Note**: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the Docker documentation.

## (Most users) Running the pre-built Docker Image

This is suitable for those who are testing Formbricks or running it with minimal to no modifications. For this we use the [public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/formbricks/formbricks) and a simple docker-compose file.

1. **Create a New Directory for Formbricks**

   Open a terminal and create a new directory for Formbricks, then navigate into this new directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir formbricks-quickstart && cd formbricks-quickstart
   ```

2. **Download the Docker-Compose File**

   Download the docker-compose file directly from the Formbricks repository:

   ```bash
   curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/docker/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. **Generate NextAuth Secret**

   Next, you need to generate a NextAuth secret. This will be used for session signing and encryption. The `sed` command below generates a random string using `openssl`, then replaces the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET:` placeholder in the `docker-compose.yml` file with this generated secret:

   ```bash
   sed -i "/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:$/s/NEXTAUTH_SECRET:.\*/NEXTAUTH_SECRET: $(openssl rand -base64 32)/" docker-compose.yml
   ```

4. **Start the Docker Setup**

   You're now ready to start the Formbricks Docker setup. The following command will start Formbricks together with a postgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The `-d` flag will run the containers in detached mode, meaning they'll run in the background.

5. **Visit Formbricks in Your Browser**

   After starting the Docker setup, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the Formbricks application. The first time you access this page, you'll be greeted by a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to define your first user and get started.

## Updating Formbricks

1. Stop the Formbricks stack

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

3. Update env vars as necessary.
4. Re-start the Formbricks stack

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## (Advanced users) Build and Run Formbricks

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks.git && cd formbricks
    ```

    Create a `.env` file based on `.env.docker` and change all fields according to your setup. This file comes with a basic setup and Formbricks works without making any changes to the file. To enable email sending functionality you need to configure the SMTP settings in the `.env` file. If you configured your email credentials, you can also comment the following lines to enable email verification (`# NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED=1`) and password reset (`# NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED=1`)

2.  Copy the `.env.docker` file to `.env` and edit it with an editor of your choice if needed.

    ```bash
    cp .env.docker .env
    ```

    Note: The environment variables are used at build time. When you change environment variables later, you need to rebuild the image with `docker compose build` for the changes to take effect.

3.  Finally start the docker compose process to build and spin up the Formbricks container as well as the PostgreSQL database.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    # (use docker-compose if you are on an older docker version)
    ```

    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will be automatically redirected to the login. To use your local installation of Formbricks, create a new account.

Certainly, here is the reformatted version for Formbricks environment variables.

Please refer to the [Formbricks Instructions](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks) for more details on generating these variables.

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

You can close the logs again with `CTRL + C`.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
