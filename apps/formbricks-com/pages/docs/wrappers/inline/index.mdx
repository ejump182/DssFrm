An inline survey is natively embedded into your user interface.

<Callout title="No UI provided" type="warning">
  Since this is highly dependent on your frontend stack, we do not yet provide any UI components. We explain how you can fill a `<div>` in your UI with the Best Practice content.
</Callout>

## Example

MATTI

## Preparation

The Best Practices come with a default pop-over in the script. We assume that you have already installed one of the Best Practices and configured it. If not, please proceed here:

- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/feedback-box">Install and configure Feedback Box</Link>
- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/pmf-survey">Install and configure Product-Market Fit survey</Link>

## Implementation

1. To inject the Best Practice in your Modal window, you have to make sure to have set the `containerID` in the config object:

```json
config: {
  hqUrl: "https://app.formbricks.com",
  formId: "cldipcgat0000mn0g31a8pdse",
  containerId: "formbricks-survey", // needs to be set
},
```

2. All you have to do then is to set the `id` of the inner div of your Modal accordingly:

```tsx
<div id="formbricks-survey"></div>
```

If you have several Best Practices embedded, you have to **make sure to use unique `id's`.**

3. Conditionally render div when Best Practice is fully loaded (React)

```tsx
MATTI;
```

## Full Example

Here is a full example file for React.js using NPM:

```tsx
MATTI;
```

## That's it ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™re Best Practice survey will be displayed in your target div when the Best Practice survey is fully loaded.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
