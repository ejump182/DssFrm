import { Layout } from "@/components/docs/Layout";
import { Fence } from "@/components/shared/Fence";
import Link from "next/link";

export const meta = {
  title: "In-app Pop-overs",
};

The pop-over opens a little survey window with the survey content.

## Example

BUTTON WITH EXAMPLE

## Preparation

The Best Practices come with a default pop-over in the script. We assume that you have already installed one of the Best Practices and configured it. If not, please proceed here:

- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/feedback-box">Install and configure Feedback Box</Link>
- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/pmf-survey">Install and configure Product-Market Fit survey</Link>

## Implementation

To implement the pop-over, all you have to do is set up a button with the following onClick handler, like so:

```tsx
<button onclick={(e) => window.formbricks.open(e)}>Feedback</button>
```

## Full Example

Here is a full example file for React.js using NPM:

```tsx
MATTI;
```

## Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™re Best Practice survey should open on button click.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
