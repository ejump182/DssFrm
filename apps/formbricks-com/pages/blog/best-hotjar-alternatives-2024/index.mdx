### Formbricks vs Hotjar

**TL;DR**: Letâ€™s see how Formbricks compares side-by-side to Hotjar.

| Factors | Formbricks | Hotjar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surveys & Forms | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ |
| Heatmaps & Recordings | ðŸ”´ | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Integrations | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ |
| Pricing | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ |
| Privacy and Compliance | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Extensibility | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸŸ¡ |

Now, weâ€™ll go into the details.

**Feature depth**

- **Surveys & Forms**: Formbricks offers a diverse range of survey templates, including options like [Product-Market fit](https://formbricks.com/docs/best-practices/pmf-survey), [Improving Newsletter Content](https://formbricks.com/docs/best-practices/improve-email-content), and NPS surveys. These surveys can be seamlessly to your website using the Formbricks SDK.

       To learn more about setting up the Formbricks widget, visit our guide on [How to set up the Formbricks widget](https://formbricks.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart-in-app-survey).
 
       Furthermore, Formbricks provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard that assists in optimizing survey conversion rates. This dashboard helps gather user data, analyze drop-offs, and track the number of users who viewed your surveys. The level of analytics provided by Formbricks is comparable to Hotjar's offerings.
 
- **Heatmaps & Recordings**: Formbricks focuses on surveys. No fancy website heatmaps here for now, but you get detailed insights into individual form fields and how users interact with them. If youâ€™re looking for open source heatmaps, OpenReplay might be worth checking out.
- **Integrations:** Formbricks integrates with popular tools like Zapier, Make.com, Airtable, Notion, and Slack, and these integrations are all available **on its Free Plan**. The Formbricks team and open-source community are continuously adding more integrations.

        Hotjar, on the other hand, offers integrations with many tools for their surveys, but these are only available on their Business Plan. The Basic plan offers just one integration (HubSpot).
 
 
 **Privacy:** Formbricks takes data privacy very seriously. Hence, we take on considerable additional effort to collect as little data as necessary and handle it safely and securely.
 
 Formbricks is easily self-hostable and if you do so you have full control over the data you collect. This removes a huge chunk of privacy compliance and security reviews because the data never leaves your servers. Our privacy policy does not apply here, since no data is ever processed by Formbricks (the company).
 
 We also offer Formbricks as a managed service in the Cloud. Formbricks Cloud is hosted by a German entity (GmbH) in Germany and comes with full GDPR and CCPA compliance. Learn more about how we handle private data on our Cloud in the [Privacy Policy](https://formbricks.com/privacy-policy). We also provide a [guide on how to create a GDPR compliant](https://formbricks.com/gdpr-guide) survey as well as [GDPR FAQs](https://formbricks.com/gdpr).
 
 **Extensibility:** Formbricks stands out for its open-source nature and extensive API access, **available on all plans**. This unique feature allows users to customize and enhance their experience without limitations. In contrast, Hotjar's API access is restricted to its Scale plan, which comes at a higher price point of **$128/month** with as little as 500 sessions / day.
 
 **Pricing**: Both tools have free plans, but Formbricks gives you more value on a free plan than Hotjar. Ultimately, Formbricks offers a lot more value for your money, especially if youâ€™re mostly interested in running surveys.
 
 If you decide to [self-host](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/deployment) Formbricks on your servers, the community edition **is completely free including Branding Removal.** If you require the Enterprise Edition because you need Team Roles, Advanced Targeting or Multi-language Surveys, [please reach out.](mailto:hola@formbricks.com)

- **Heatmaps & Recordings:** Mouseflow, like Hojar, provides heatmaps and session recordings to visualize user interactions and behaviors, aiding in the analysis of website engagement.
         
         However, Hotjar samples the data you collect daily. That is, you are allowed to review just a small fraction of the whole set of data you receive daily. For example, if you have 3000 recordings per month, you are allowed to record just 100 daily sessions on standard plans.

## So, which option is the better fit for you?

If you're seeking a comprehensive solution encompassing heatmaps, recordings, surveys, and a strong focus on privacy, MouseFlow emerges as a prime choice.
