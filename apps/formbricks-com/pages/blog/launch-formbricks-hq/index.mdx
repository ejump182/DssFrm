_Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of Formbricks HQ, the newest addition to our suite of open source survey tools! Formbricks HQ is an easy-to-use product that allows developers to quickly and easily create, manage, and deploy forms for their websites, without the need for a server._

### What can you use it for?

In our last [Weekly Update](/blog/weekly-update-021222), we already shared the use case of polling users natively in your app or webshop and showing them the results right away.

## Use case: Native NPS survey

To showcase the power of Formbricks HQ, we built another common use case: The NPS survey. We used Formbricks React to build the survey natively into our example app. When the survey is submitted, the data is sent to Formbricks HQ and displayed.

### What is a schema good for?

The cool thing - apart from you being able to self-host and customize the complete solution - is that Frombricks React and HQ are using the same schema.

Weâ€™ve wrote about the [benefit in-depth in our Docs](/docs/formbricks-hq/schema), but here is the benefit in a nutshell:

You get a full image of the survey data including questions and not selected options. Without a schema, your stuck with the data which is sent along so the selected value and the input label. Here is the difference:

<Image src={NoSchema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />
<Image src={Schema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />

## What else can you use Formbricks HQ for?

Apart from the use case above, you can send any form data to your personal endpoint. Here is a short tutorial on how to do that, [the full guide is in our docs](/docs/react-form-library/link-formbricks-hq):

1. Sign up at [hq.formbricks.com](http://hq.formbricks.com)
2. Create a new form
3. Copy the endpoint to your form action
4. Receive responses
