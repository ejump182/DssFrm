#### Integrations

# Google Sheets

The Google Sheets integration allows you to automatically send responses to a Google Sheet of your choice.

<Note>
  This feature is enabled by default in Formbricks Cloud but needs to be self-configured when running a
  self-hosted version of Formbricks.
</Note>

## Setup in self-hosted Formbricks

Enabling the Google Sheets Integration in a self-hosted environment isn't easy and requires a setup using Google Cloud and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

The environment variables you need to set are:

- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_REDIRECT_URL`
