#### In-App Surveys

# User Identification

User Identification helps you to not only segment your users but also to see more information about the user who responded to a survey. This helps you to target surveys to specific user segments and see more information about the user who responded to a survey.

### Understanding Identified vs Unidentified Users

In Formbricks, understanding the distinction between identified and unidentified users is crucial for effective survey segmentation and targeted feedback collection.

| Feature                                                    | Unidentified Users | Identified Users |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Can be targeted with surveys                               | ✅               | ✅                 |
| Have **Personification** of the user                       | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Can have **custom attributes**                             | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Can be **specifically targeted** based on their attributes | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Can be filtered by userId                                  | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Can be filtered by custom attributes                       | ❌               | ✅                 |


## Identified Users
Identified users are those for whom specific information has been set, notably the userId. This identification allows for more precise targeting of surveys and a deeper understanding of the feedback provided.

**Setting the User ID:**
To identify a user, set the `userId` in the Formbricks initialization call. The userId should be a unique string, such as a database ID or an email address. This is essential for the user to be visible on the Formbricks dashboard.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting User ID">

```javascript
formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user_id>",
});
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

**Logging Out Users:**
When a user logs out of your application, ensure they are also logged out of Formbricks. This prevents the association of their activities with the wrong user profile.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Logging out User">

```javascript
formbricks.logout();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

<Note>
    To set other custom attributes for a user, view our <a href="/docs/in-app-surveys/attributes#setting-custom-user-attributes">Setting Custom Attributes</a> documentation.
</Note>

## Unidentified Users
Unidentified users are those without a specific userId set. Surveys can still be presented to these users, but without the granularity of user-specific targeting.
