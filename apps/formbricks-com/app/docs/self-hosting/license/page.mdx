# License

The Formbricks core application is released under the [AGPLv3 Open Source License](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/LICENSE). The core application is fully functional on it's own and includes all the functionality needed to design & run link surveys as well as targeted in-app surveys for your project. You can use the software for free (even commercially), distribute modified versions as long as you keep track of the changes and the date you made them, and license derivatives under the AGPL as well.

For some additional functionality that is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core, and that is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises, we offer an Enterprise license. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an [Enterprise License Key](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/license) to unlock it. The [code](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/packages/ee) and [license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE) for the enterprise functionality can be found in the `/packages/ee` folder of the Formbricks repository.
If you have other special licensing requests, such as whitelabeling our enterprise functionality, please send us an [email](mailto:hola@formbricks.com).

Providing these paid enterprise features funds the Formbricks team and allows us to work on the project full time and release the main application under a free open source license.
