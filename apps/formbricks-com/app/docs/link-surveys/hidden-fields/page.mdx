# Hidden Fields

Hidden fields are a powerful feature in Formbricks that allows you to add data to a submission without asking the user to type it in. This feature is especially useful when you already have information about a user that you want to use in the analysis of the survey results (e.g. `payment plan` or `email`)


## How to Add Hidden Fields

This is not visible in the survey flow and is only captured in the responses. You can use hidden fields to capture internal data such as:


### Single Hidden Field
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Example Screen from which the User filled it">

```sh
https://formbricks.com/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?screen=Dashboard
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Multiple Hidden Fields

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Example Screen from which the User filled it">

```sh
https://formbricks.com/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?screen=Dashboard&job=Engineer
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

These hidden fields will now be visible in the responses tab, and you can use them to filter and analyze your responses.

## Use Cases

- **Tracking Source**: You can add a hidden field to track the source of the survey. For a detailed guide on Source Tracking, check out the [Source Tracking](/docs/link-surveys/source-tracking) guide.
- **User Metadata**: You can add hidden fields to capture user metadata such as user ID, email, or any other user-specific information.
- **Survey Metadata**: You can add hidden fields to capture other metadata the screen from which the survey was filled, or any other app specific information.
