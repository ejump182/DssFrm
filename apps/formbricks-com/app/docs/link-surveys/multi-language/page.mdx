# Multi Language Surveys

Multi-Language Surveys allows you to create surveys that support multiple languages, making it easier to reach a diverse audience without creating separate surveys for each language. This feature simplifies the creation, delivery, and analysis of surveys for users with multilingual audiences just by setting a query parameter in the survey URL.

## Example Link Survey

- English: https://formbricks.com/clptfos2i1pj516pvhxqyu3bn?lang=en
- German: https://formbricks.com/clptfos2i1pj516pvhxqyu3bn?lang=de

Focus on the `lang` query parameter in the above URLs. You can share the survey link with the `?lang=en` query parameter to show the survey in the selected language assuming the survey creator has configured it.

## How to Setup Multi Language Surveys

<Note>
  Multi-Language is feature of the Enterprise Edition. Use it for free by adding your credit card details on the Formbricks Cloud.
</Note>

1. On the Formbricks dashboard, from the top-right drop-down, open the "Survey Languages" page.

<MdxImage src={HomePage} alt="Formbricks Home" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />

2. Click on the **Edit Languages** button to add a new language to your survey

3. Select the language you want to add from the dropdown, optionally give an Alias to it (a custom identifier for this language) and click on the **Add Language** button.

<MdxImage
  src={AddLanguages}
  alt="Add Multiple Languages to your Product"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

4. You can come back to this page anytime to add more languages or remove existing ones.

5. Now, go back to the dashboard and create a new survey or edit an existing one.

6. In the survey editor, scroll down to the **Multiple Languages** section at the bottom & enable the toggle next to it.

<MdxImage
  src={EnableMultiLang}
  alt="Enable Multi Language for a survey"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

7. Now choose a **Default Language** for your survey. This is the language that will be shown to users who have not selected a preferred language.

<Note>
    Changing the default language will reset all the translations you have made for the survey.
</Note>

8. Now, add the languages from the dropdown that you want to support in your survey.

9. You can now see the survey in the selected language by clicking on the language dropdown in any of the questions.

10. You can now translate the survey questions, options, and messages to the selected language.

11. Once you are done, click on the **Publish** button to save the survey.

12. Now, copy the survey link, and share it with your users appending the `lang` query parameter with the language alias you have set.
    
    For example, if you have set the alias for French as `fr`, you can share the survey link as
    
     `https://your-survey-url.com?lang=fr`

13. Start collecting responses in multiple languages! You can filter responses by language in the summary page.
