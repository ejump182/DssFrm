#### Embed Surveys

# Embed Surveys in Your Web Page

Embedding Formbricks surveys directly into your web pages allows you to integrate interactive surveys without redirecting users to a separate survey site. This method ensures a seamless integration and maintains the aesthetic continuity of your website or application.

## How to Use it?

<TellaVideo tellaVideoIdentifier="clvavyy2f00000fjr0mple922"/>

1. Create and publish a link survey.

2. Open survey summary page and click on **share** button on the top right.

3. In the survey share modal, click on **Embed survey** button.

4. Navigate to **Embed in a Web Page** tab and click on Copy code

5. Paste the copied iframe code into the HTML of your web page where you want the survey to appear.

<CodeGroup title="Example Embedding Code">

```html
<div style="position: relative; height:100vh; max-height:100vh; overflow:auto;">
  <iframe
    src="https://app.formbricks.com/s/<your-surveyId>"
    frameborder="0"
    style="position: absolute; left:0; top:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Iframe Events

The iframe fires a **formbricksSurveyCompleted** event when a user finishes a survey within the embedded iframe. This event can be captured through a message listener in your webpage's JavaScript

### How to Use it?

1. Embed the Formbricks survey on your webpage using the iframe method as described above.

2. Add an event listener to your webpageâ€™s JavaScript that listens for `message` events from the iframe.

3. Check if the received message indicates that the survey is completed by comparing the `event.data` with the value `formbricksSurveyCompleted`.

<Note>
  It is important to verify the origin of the message to ensure it comes from the iframe containing your
  survey, enhancing the security of your event handling.
</Note>

4. Implement your custom actions within the callback function based on the survey completion.

    console.log("Survey completed!");
    // Implement your custom actions here
  }
});
