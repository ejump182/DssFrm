#### Link Surveys

# Embed Surveys in Your Email

Embedding Formbricks surveys directly into your emails allows you to collect valuable feedback from your users at every touchpoint. Seamlessly integrate interactive surveys into your email campaigns to gather insights and improve user experience.

## Generate an Embed Code

To embed a Formbricks survey in an email, first, create a survey and publish it. Follow these steps to generate the embed code:

1. **Create and Publish a Survey**: Start by creating a link survey and publish it once ready.
2. **Access the Share Options**: Go to the survey summary page and click the Share button (see below).
3. **Get the Embed Code**: Click on Embed Survey at the bottom of the share modal, navigate to the `Embed in an Email` tab, and click `Copy Code`.
4. **Preview and Test**: Before sending it to your users, click on Send Preview to receive a test email. This helps ensure the survey appears correctly.

## Embedding the Survey in Emails

Different email clients have different support for HTML and CSS. We recommend testing the email in different email clients to ensure the survey looks good in all of them.

Below are some of the methods and services that we know that allows HTML embedding and how you can use them:

<Note>
  Please use the below methods at your own discretion. We do not officially endorse any of the services
  mentioned below.
</Note>

### 1. Gmail

Gmail does not support HTML embedding natively. It's a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. However, you can use a free plugin like [HTML Editor for Gmail by cloudHQ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/free-html-editor-for-gmai/ioinaaeeacahcmbgfmeaaofhfkijpdeb) to embed HTML in your emails.

   - Install the plugin from the Chrome Web Store.
   - Open Gmail and compose a new email.
   - Write your email content after which you want to embed the survey.

   <MdxImage
     src={EmailContentWithoutSurvey}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

   - Right next to the Send button you will see a new button called **HTML Editor**. Click on it.
   - This will open a new window with the **Design** tab active. Switch to the **Source** tab.

   <MdxImage
     src={PluginSourceTab}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

   - Now paste the copied HTML code from Formbricks into this window. On the right, you will see a preview of how the email will look.

   <MdxImage
     src={PluginAddSurvey}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

   - Click on the **Close Editor** button to save the changes & close the editor.

   <MdxImage
     src={EmailContentWithSurvey}
     alt="Choose a link survey template"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

   - Voila! You have successfully embedded the survey in your email.

### 2. Sendgrid

Sendgrid supports HTML content in emails directly:

   - Compose Your Email: Use Sendgrid's email composition tools to embed the HTML directly into your email body.
   - Reference: For detailed steps, refer to Sendgrid's official documentation [here](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-marketing/email-design) or API docs [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started/)

### 3. Mailchimp

Available in their Standard plan and above, Mailchimp allows HTML content embedding:

   - Use the Code Block: Drag a code block into your email template and paste the HTML code for the survey.
   - Reference: Check out Mailchimp's guide on pasting in custom HTML [here](https://mailchimp.com/help/paste-in-html-to-create-an-email/)

### 4. Notemailer

Nodemailer is a Node.js module that allows you to send emails with HTML content.

   - If you use Node.js to send emails, just attach the `html` parameter in your email message.
   - Reference: Take a look at Nodemailer's official message documentation [here](https://nodemailer.com/message/)

<Note>
  Please note that the above methods are not exhaustive and there are many other ways to embed HTML in emails.
</Note>

## Example: Email Footer Survey

Embed a survey link in your email signature to collect feedback subtly yet effectively. Here‚Äôs how:

<MdxImage
  src={JoSignature}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

1. Create a Survey: Adjust an existing survey or create a new one.
2. Scroll down & enable the **Hidden Fields** option.
3. Add a new hidden field with the name **helpful**.
4. Now Publish the survey as a Link Survey & copy the link.
5. Embed in Your Signature: Add this HTML snippet to your email signature in your email client settings.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Embed this in your Email">

```html
Was our conversation helpful? <a href="<Link-Survey-URL>?helpful=Yes">Yes üëç</a> | <a href="<Link-Survey-URL>?helpful=No">No üëé</a>
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

Replace `YOUR_SURVEY_LINK` with the actual survey link.

PS: If you do not see any signature settings, just use one of the methods we've mentioned above to embed the HTML code in your email.
