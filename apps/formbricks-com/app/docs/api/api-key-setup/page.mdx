# API Key Setup

## Auth: Personal API key

The API requests are authorized with a personal API key. This API key gives you the same rights as if you were logged in at formbricks.com - **don't share it around!**

### How to generate an API key

1. Go to your settings on [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com).
2. Go to page “API keys”
   <Image src={AddApiKey} alt="Add API Key" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />
3. Create a key for the development or production environment.
4. Copy the key immediately. You won’t be able to see it again.
   <Image
     src={ApiKeySecret}
     alt="API Key Secret"
     quality="100"
     className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

<Note>
  ## Store API key safely {{ class: "text-white" }}
  Anyone who has your API key has full control over your account. For security reasons, you cannot view the API
  key again.
</Note>

### Delete a personal API key

1. Go to settings on [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/).
2. Go to page “API keys”.
3. Find the key you wish to revoke and select “Delete”.
4. Your API key will stop working immediately.
