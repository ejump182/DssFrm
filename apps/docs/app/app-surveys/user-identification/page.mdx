#### App Surveys

# User Identification

User Identification helps you to not only segment your users but also to see more information about the user who responded to a survey. This helps you to target surveys to specific user segments and see more information about the user who responded to a survey.

### Understanding Identified vs Unidentified Users

<Note>
  Formbricks App Surveys can **only be used with identified users**. If you are looking to run surveys on your
  public-facing website, head over to the [Website Surveys](/website-surveys/quickstart) section.
</Note>

In Formbricks, understanding the distinction between identified and unidentified users is crucial for effective survey segmentation and targeted feedback collection.

## Identified Users

Identified users are those for whom specific information has been set, notably the userId. This identification allows for more precise targeting of surveys and a deeper understanding of the feedback provided. When enabled, all information specified by you and all actions are sent to Formbricks.

This method is recommended for applications where users are required to log in and will often return.

**Setting the User ID:**
To identify a user, set the `userId` in the Formbricks initialization call. The userId should be a unique string, such as a database ID or an email address. This is essential for the user to be visible on the Formbricks dashboard.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Initialization with a user ID">

```javascript
formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user_id>",
});
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

**Logging Out Users:**
When a user logs out of your application, ensure they are also logged out of Formbricks. This prevents the association of their activities with the wrong user profile.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Logging out User">

```javascript
formbricks.logout();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
