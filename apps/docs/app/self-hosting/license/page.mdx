#### Self-Hosting

# License

## Overview

Formbricks core source code is under AGPL license on GitHub. Additionally, we also have additional features for bigger teams & enterprises under the Enterprise license for Self Hosting customers. Let’s understand both in depth below:

## Enterprise Edition License

Additional to the AGPL licensed Formbricks core, the Formbricks repository contains code licensed under an **[Enterprise license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE)**. This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an **Enterprise License Key** to unlock it. For the pricing, please refer to [Formbricks Pricing](https://formbricks.com/pricing).

The core application is fully functional and includes everything you need to design & run link surveys, website surveys and in-app surveys. You can use the software for free for personal and commercial use. You're also allowed to create and distribute modified versions as long as you document the changes you make incl. date. The AGPL license requires you to publish your modified version under the AGPLv3 license as well.

The **[code](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/packages/ee)** and **[license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE)** for the enterprise functionality can be found in the `/packages/ee` folder of this repository.
